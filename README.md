# Ema-sApp
This is a personal project. 
I made an app for a restaurant with food and delivery services. The client can order what he wants to eat and he needs an account, so, he can have some discounts.
This app has 6 sections: 
-1st section: the home section
-2nd section: the menu with all of the foods and meals
-3rd section: the orders of the customer
-4th section: the coupons with different discounts
-5th section: the details about the account
-6th section: the feedback of the clients
